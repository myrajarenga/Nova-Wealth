# Cursor Rules for This Project

## Tech Stack
- Framework: React 18
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- Language: JavaScript (ES2022+) with JSX
- Tooling: ESLint + Prettier (recommended), PostCSS, autoprefixer

## Assistant Behavior
- Prefer minimal, focused edits per change; preserve existing patterns and formatting.
- Generate only the code necessary to satisfy the request; avoid speculative scaffolding.
- When creating files, also add any required imports/exports to integrate them.
- Keep components small and composable; extract UI pieces into reusable components in `src/components`.
- Follow the conventions below without asking for confirmation unless ambiguities arise.

## Project Structure (convention)
- `src/components/` — Reusable presentational/compound components
- `src/pages/` — Route-level views (if using React Router)
- `src/hooks/` — Custom hooks
- `src/lib/` — Utilities, helpers, constants
- `src/assets/` — Static assets (images, svg, fonts)
- `src/styles/` — Tailwind entry (e.g., `tailwind.css`), global styles

## File Naming
- React components: PascalCase filenames, e.g., `Button.jsx`.
- Hooks: `useSomething.js`.
- Utility modules: `verbNoun.js` (e.g., `formatCurrency.js`).
- Test files (if added): `*.test.jsx` colocated next to implementation or in `__tests__`.

## React Conventions
- Functional components only. Use React hooks; no class components.
- Props interfaces: document via JSDoc where helpful. Keep prop shapes flat and explicit.
- State: prefer local state; lift state only when needed. Use `useReducer` for complex state.
- Effects: keep effects idempotent; declare all dependencies. Avoid side effects during render.
- Lists: always provide stable `key` (prefer IDs over index).
- Accessibility: use semantic HTML, label controls, and keyboard interactions.

## Tailwind CSS Conventions
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS. Add styles via `className`.
- Group classes logically: layout → spacing → typography → color → state → responsive.
- Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) and dark mode (`dark:`) where applicable.
- Extract repeated class sets into small components or helper functions when duplication appears.
- Use Tailwind config theme tokens (colors/spacing) rather than arbitrary values when possible.

## Styling Guidelines
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not introduce additional CSS frameworks; rely on Tailwind utilities and variants.
- If a component requires complex variants, consider a prop-driven API and conditional class composition.

## Data Fetching
- Use `fetch` or a lightweight wrapper; handle loading, error, and empty states explicitly.
- Keep network calls in hooks (e.g., `src/hooks/useSomething.js`) or in `src/lib/api` modules.
- Avoid calling APIs directly inside presentational components.

## Error Handling
- Provide user-friendly messages; avoid leaking technical details to the UI.
- Fail safely; render fallback UI for error states and suspense.

## Routing (if applicable)
- Use React Router v6+ patterns: route elements in `src/pages`, lazy-load route components when appropriate.

## State Management
- Start with React state and context. Introduce external state only if patterns require it.

## Testing (optional but recommended)
- Use React Testing Library for components, focus on behavior over implementation.
- Prefer integration-style tests for critical flows.

## Code Style
- Descriptive names: prefer full words (no cryptic abbreviations).
- Early returns over deep nesting; small pure functions where possible.
- Avoid unnecessary try/catch; handle only expected error boundaries.
- Keep components under ~200 lines; extract logic to hooks/helpers when larger.

## Linting & Formatting
- Follow ESLint (React, hooks) and Prettier defaults if present.
- Do not disable rules globally; prefer targeted disables with rationale.

## Commits & PRs
- Use Conventional Commits style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Small, reviewable changes; include a brief summary of impact.

## Documentation in Code
- Only add comments for non-obvious rationale, edge cases, or invariants.
- Keep comments concise; avoid restating what the code clearly expresses.

## Accessibility Checklist (when changing UI)
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA with Tailwind palette.
- Provide visible focus states (Tailwind `focus:` utilities).
- Use landmarks and semantic elements; label controls and form fields.

## Performance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders: memoize expensive computations and stable callbacks when profiling shows need.
- Prefer CSS-based animations/transitions over JS where possible.

## Environment & Config
- Tailwind entry file should import base/components/utilities.
- Ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are present and kept minimal.
- Keep secrets out of the repo; use environment variables for keys.

## When Unsure
- Prefer the simplest implementation that solves the current requirement.
- Match existing patterns in this repo before introducing new ones.
